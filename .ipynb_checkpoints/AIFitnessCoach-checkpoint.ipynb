    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Fitness Coach** is an AI-powered conversational fitness assistant that provides **personalized workout recommendations** and **calculated nutrition targets** based on user biometrics. Built using **Gemini 2.0 Flash** via OpenAI-compatible API with real-time integration to the **Wger Workout Manager API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot follows a multi-layer design:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intent Clarity Layer** - Gathers comprehensive user fitness profile including biometrics (age, height, weight)\n",
    "2. **Intent Confirmation Layer** - Verifies all fitness requirements and biometric data are captured\n",
    "3. **Workout Mapping Layer** - Fetches and classifies exercises from external API\n",
    "4. **Fitness Matching Layer** - Matches user profile to suitable workouts using rule-based scoring + biometric adjustments\n",
    "5. **Nutrition Calculation Layer** - Calculates BMR, TDEE, and exact macro targets based on biometrics\n",
    "6. **Recommendation Layer** - Presents personalized workouts and calculated nutrition targets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personalized Nutrition Calculations** - Exact protein, carb, and fat targets based on BMR/TDEE calculations using Mifflin-St Jeor or Katch-McArdle formulas\n",
    "- **Biometric-Adjusted Workouts** - Exercise recommendations adjusted based on BMI, body fat %, and muscle mass\n",
    "- **Optional InBody Data Support** - Enhanced personalization with body fat %, skeletal muscle mass, and total body water\n",
    "- **Two-Strike Moderation** - First warning redirects to fitness, second violation ends session\n",
    "- **Dynamic Exercise Database** - Real-time API integration with Wger + fallback database\n",
    "- **Equipment-Aware Recommendations** - Filters exercises by available equipment\n",
    "- **Limitation-Safe Workouts** - Excludes exercises that may aggravate injuries\n"

      "**Workout Frequency:** 3-4 days per week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday).\n",
      "**Time per Session:** Approximately 45 minutes.\n",
      "**Equipment:** Basic (bodyweight, potentially a dumbbell/kettlebell, sturdy furniture).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Warm-up (5-10 minutes)\n",
      "Start every session with a dynamic warm-up to prepare your body for exercise.\n",
      "*   **Light Cardio:** 2-3 minutes of jogging in place, high knees, or butt kicks.\n",
      "*   **Dynamic Stretches:** Arm circles (forward and backward), leg swings (front-to-back and side-to-side), torso twists, cat-cow stretches.\n",

      "1.  **Bear Walk (Chest, Core)**\n",
      "    *   **Sets:** 3\n",
      "    *   **Reps:** 10-15 meters (or 30-45 seconds)\n",
      "    *   **Rest:** 60-90 seconds\n",
      "    *   *Notes: A fantastic full-body movement that builds core strength and shoulder stability. Keep your hips low and back flat.*\n",

      "2.  **Single Arm Plank to Row (Back, Core)**\n",
      "    *   **Sets:** 3\n",
      "    *   **Reps:** 8-12 per arm\n",
      "    *   **Rest:** 60-90 seconds\n",
      "    *   *Notes: This exercise requires one dumbbell or kettlebell. If you don't have one, perform a standard Plank with alternating shoulder taps for core stability and anti-rotation work.*\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Pike Push-ups (Alternative for Handstand Push Up - Shoulders)**\n",
      "    *   **Sets:** 3\n",
      "    *   **Reps:** 8-12\n",
      "    *   **Rest:** 60-90 seconds\n",
      "    *   *Notes: The Handstand Push Up is an advanced move. For a beginner with basic equipment, Pike Push-ups are an excellent way to build foundational shoulder strength. Elevate your feet on a sturdy chair or bench for increased difficulty as you progress.*\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Kettlebell Swing (Abs, Glutes, Hips)**\n",
      "    *   **Sets:** 3\n",
      "    *   **Reps:** 10-15\n",
      "    *   **Rest:** 60-90 seconds\n",
      "    *   *Notes: Focus on a powerful hip hinge, driving the movement from your glutes and hips, not your arms. If you don't have a kettlebell, perform **Squat Jumps** for a similar explosive lower body and core workout.*\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Inverted Rows (Alternative for TRX Rows - Back, Biceps)**\n",
      "    *   **Sets:** 3\n",

      "    *   **Rest:** 60-90 seconds\n",
      "    *   *Notes: TRX Rows require specific equipment. You can perform Inverted Rows using a sturdy table, a low bar, or even a strong bedsheet tied securely over a door. This is excellent for building pulling strength.*\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Decline Pushups (Chest, Shoulders)**\n",

      "    *   **Rest:** 60-90 seconds\n",

      "    *   **Rest:** 60 seconds\n",
      "    *   *Notes: Cable machines are not basic equipment. If you have light dumbbells, perform this exercise bent over. If no dumbbells, use a resistance band for **Band Pull-Aparts** to target your rear deltoids.*\n",

      "8.  **Dumbbell Flyes (Alternative for Butterfly - Chest)**\n",

      "    *   **Reps:** 45-60 seconds work, 30 seconds rest\n",

      "\n",
      "**Understanding Your Protein Target:**\n",
      "Your protein target of **130-173g per day** is specifically tailored for muscle building. This range corresponds to approximately 1.8-2.4 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight (72 kg), which is optimal for muscle repair and growth, especially when you're a beginner lifting weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Nutrition Tips for Muscle Building:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fuel Your Recovery:** Aim to consume a protein-rich meal or snack within 2 hours after your workout to aid muscle repair and growth.\n",
      "*   **Consistent Fueling:** Don't skip meals! Eating every 3-4 hours helps maintain energy levels and provides a steady supply of nutrients for your muscles.\n",
      "*   **Healthy Fats are Essential:** Include sources of healthy fats like nuts, seeds, avocado, and olive oil in your diet. They are vital for hormone production and overall health.\n",
      "*   **Prioritize Sleep:** Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is crucial for muscle recovery and growth. Your body does most of its repair work while you rest.\n",
